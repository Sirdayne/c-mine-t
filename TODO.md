## TTI & FID

Rehydration bottleneck

- [ ] Fork and patch Vue
- [ ] Use npm resolution package to help Nuxt resolve patched Vue
- [ ] Wrap unnecessary ssr-only components
      like svg icons
      posts (use event delegation and link-resolver logic)

## Necessary cleaning

Lightweight `consulting/vendors` section

- [ ] 1d Request data and i18n separately from main requests
      Make promo buttons great at least once
- [ ] 1d Request data and i18n to pAPI
